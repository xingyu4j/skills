# Skills Generator

Generate [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/home) from project documentation.

PLEASE STRICTLY FOLLOW THE BEST PRACTICES FOR SKILL: https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/best-practices

- Focus on agents capabilities and practical usage patterns.
- Ignore user-facing guides, introductions, get-started, install guides, etc.
- Ignore content that LLM agents already confident about in their training data.
- Make the skill as concise as possible, avoid creating too many references.

## Skill Source Types

There are four types of skill sources. The project lists are defined in `meta.ts`:

### Type 1: Generated Skills (`sources/`)

For OSS projects **without existing skills**. We clone the repo as a submodule and generate skills from their documentation.

- **Projects:** Vue, Nuxt, Vite, Pinia, VitePress, Vitest, pnpm, Vben, Tailwind CSS
- **Workflow:** Read docs → Understand → Generate skills
- **Source:** `sources/{project}/docs/`

### Type 2: Synced Skills (`vendor/`)

For projects that **already maintain their own skills**. We clone their repo as a submodule and sync specified skills to ours.

- **Projects:** Slidev, VueUse, tsdown, Turborepo, vuejs-ai (vue-best-practices, vue-router-best-practices, vue-testing-best-practices), web-design-guidelines
- **Workflow:** Pull updates → Copy specified skills (with optional renaming)
- **Source:** `vendor/{project}/skills/{skill-name}/`
- **Config:** Each vendor specifies which skills to sync and their output names in `meta.ts`

### Type 3: Hand-written Skills

For skills that are written by xingyu with preferences, experience, tastes and best practices.

- **Skills:** antfu
- You don't need to do anything about them unless being asked.

### Type 4: Community Skills

Third-party community skills, manually curated and maintained. These are hand-written based on external project documentation but are not auto-generated from submodules.

- **Skills:** inspira-ui, nuxt-content, nuxt-seo
- **Instructions:** `instructions/{project}.md`
- **Workflow:** Read external docs → Write skills manually → Maintain by hand

│
└── skills/                     # Output directory (generated, synced, or hand-written)
    └── {output-name}/
        ├── SKILL.md           # Index of all skills
        ├── GENERATION.md       # Tracking metadata (for generated skills, Type 1)
        ├── SYNC.md             # Tracking metadata (for synced skills, Type 2)
        └── references/
            └── *.md            # Individual skill files
```

**Important:** For Type 1 (generated), the `skills/{project}/` name must match `sources/{project}/`. For Type 2 (synced), the output name is configured in `meta.ts` and may differ from the source skill name.

## Workflows

### For Generated Skills (Type 1)

#### Adding a New Project

1. **Add entry to `meta.ts`** in the `submodules` object:
   ```ts
   export const submodules = {
     // ... existing entries
     'new-project': 'https://github.com/org/repo',
   }
   ```

2. **Run sync script** to clone the submodule:
   ```bash
   nr start init -y
   ```
   This will clone the repository to `sources/{project}/`

3. **Follow the generation guide** below to create the skills

#### General Instructions for Generation

- Focus on agents capabilities and practical usage patterns. For user-facing guides, introductions, get-started, or common knowledge that LLM agents already know, you can skip those content.
- Categorize each references into `core`, `features`, `best-practices`, `advanced`, etc categories, and prefix the reference file name with the category. For each feature field, feel free to create more categories if needed to better organize the content.

#### Creating New Skills

- **Read** source docs from `sources/{project}/docs/`
- **Read** the instructions in `instructions/{project}.md` for specific generation instructions if exists
- **Understand** the documentation thoroughly
- **Create** skill files in `skills/{project}/references/`
- **Create** `SKILL.md` index listing all skills
- **Create** `GENERATION.md` with the source git SHA

#### Updating Generated Skills

1. **Check** git diff since the SHA recorded in `GENERATION.md`:
   ```bash
   cd sources/{project}
   git diff {old-sha}..HEAD -- docs/
   ```
2. **Update** affected skill files based on changes
3. **Update** `SKILL.md` with the new version of the tool/project and skills table.
4. **Update** `GENERATION.md` with new SHA

### For Synced Skills (Type 2)

#### Initial Sync

1. **Copy** specified skills from `vendor/{project}/skills/{skill-name}/` to `skills/{output-name}/`
2. **Create** `SYNC.md` with the vendor git SHA

#### Updating Synced Skills

1. **Check** git diff since the SHA recorded in `SYNC.md`:
   ```bash
   cd vendor/{project}
   git diff {old-sha}..HEAD -- skills/{skill-name}/
   ```
2. **Copy** changed files from `vendor/{project}/skills/{skill-name}/` to `skills/{output-name}/`
3. **Update** `SYNC.md` with new SHA

**Note:** Do NOT modify synced skills manually. Changes should be contributed upstream to the vendor project.

### For Community Skills (Type 4)

#### Adding a New Community Skill

1. **Create** `instructions/{project}.md` with generation instructions
2. **Create** skill files in `skills/{project}/references/`
3. **Create** `SKILL.md` index listing all skills

#### Updating Community Skills

Community skills are maintained by hand. Check the upstream project documentation for changes and update accordingly.

## File Formats

### `SKILL.md`

Index file listing all skills with brief descriptions. Name should be in `kebab-case`.

The version should be the date of the last sync.

Also record the version of the tool/project when the skills were generated.

At the end of the file, include the reference links to the source documentation.

```markdown
---
name: {name}
description: {description}

# {Concept Name}

Brief description of what this skill covers.

## Usage

## Key Points

- Important detail 1
- Important detail 2

<!--

- {source-url}
- {source-url}
- {source-url}

```

## Writing Guidelines

When generating skills (Type 1) or community skills (Type 4):

1. **Rewrite for agents** - Don't copy docs verbatim; synthesize for LLM consumption
2. **Be practical** - Focus on usage patterns and code examples
3. **Be concise** - Remove fluff, keep essential information
4. **One concept per file** - Split large topics into separate skill files
5. **Include code** - Always provide working code examples
6. **Explain why** - Not just how to use, but when and why

## Supported Projects

See `meta.ts` for the canonical list of projects and their repository URLs.
